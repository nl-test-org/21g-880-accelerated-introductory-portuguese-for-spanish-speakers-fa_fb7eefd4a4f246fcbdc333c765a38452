Class Attendance, Participation, and Homework
---------------------------------------------

Your presence and active participation are essential in each and every session. This will be the most significant part of your grade since it is through continuous class interaction with other students that your communicative abilities in Portuguese will develop and improve. Your grade will be determined daily by the quality and quantity of your preparation and participation in class discussions, activities, group work, etc.

As your progress, and that of the class as a whole, will be impeded by excessive absences, your presence in the classroom is imperative. If you must miss a class, there is no excuse for not being prepared for the next one. If you have to be absent, please contact the instructor in advance to find out what material you will miss. Each absence without an official excuse will lower your course attendance and participation grade. Any student who has accumulated more than three absences without an official excuse must see the instructor. Further absences after the warning will affect your final grade. 

Oral Presentation
-----------------

Oral presentation: In addition to the written quizzes, students will make a 10–minute oral presentation in front of the class. Students may talk about a place where Portuguese is spoken or an historically or culturally significant figure in the Lusophone world. Alternatively, they can choose to talk about a personal trip

Homework and Written Work
-------------------------

Students are expected to prepare the assigned materials for each class and complete the written work as stipulated in the syllabus. These assignments include:

*   Studying the vocabulary and grammar in _Ponto de Encontro_ and completing **any written** exercises assigned.
*   Completing the exercises in the _MyPortugueseLab_. The solutions to most exercises are provided immediately. Exercises requiring long written answers will be corrected by the instructor.
*   Compositions (redações): Total of **four** pieces of writing based on the short stories read in class. They should be at least 150 words long (15 lines), typed and double-spaced. Compositions should be turned in on the day assigned in the daily program. Once returned by the teacher, a second version with corrections must be handed in. If an essay has two pages, they should be stapled.

All assignments are to be done on the date indicated. **Late work will not receive full credit**. The exercises in _MyPortugueseLAb_ are designed to reinforce the grammar and vocabulary introduced in the textbook, as well as to improve your listening comprehension. They are required components of the course and it's important that you complete them right away, as soon as the material is covered. Don't let your homework pile up. Working a little every day and frequent reviewing are more effective than a few long sessions of study at longer intervals.
